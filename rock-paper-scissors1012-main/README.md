Rock, Paper, Scissors game

We will do project in a website, and it will have three choice for Rock, Paper and Scissors. We will put two opponents against each other. One of them will be computer, other one will be player side. There will also be a bet mode. We will give a time and player will choose its choice in this time. We will put a counter and it will count winning count. We will keep the information on the scoreboard. We have also included another mode called bet mode.
